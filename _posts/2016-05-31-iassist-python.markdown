## Description 

Data professionals supporting researchers provide valuable services throughout the data management life cycle. According to recent surveys, up to 80% of a data scientist's time can be spent cleaning, harmonizing and integrating data (a.k.a.: data wrangling). While there are many useful tools available to assist with these types of workflows, knowledge of basic programming can be extremely empowering.

This full day workshop will provide an introduction to Python - one of the most popular and versatile languages in use today.

No prior programming experience required! The workshop will be split into two parts: "Basic Python Programming" in the morning, and "Working with Data using Python" in the afternoon.

## Set up 

Sign-up for an account with SageMathCloud using the email you use to register for the workshop with <https://cloud.sagemath.com/>.

## Requirements

Participants are required to abide by a [Code of Conduct](http://software-carpentry.org/conduct.html). We are using the Software Carpentry Code for this workshop.

## Outcomes

Users will be able to:

* proficiently use scientific notebooks in the cloud
* write basic python programs
* operate on csv files
* transform web-fetched json data into csv format
* reference materials
