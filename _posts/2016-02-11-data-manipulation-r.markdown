## Description

This course aims to teach participants basic concepts, skills, and tools for working more effectively with data. This workshop was designed for those interested in working with Genomics data in R. In this course, we will use the data manipulation package (dplyr) and the visualization package (ggplot2) to demonstrate how you can subset, filter, aggregate and visualization your data. You should have attended the previous R workshop on 2/9 or have some basic R knowledge.  Participants are encouraged to bring their own laptops and install R and RStudio prior to the workshop.
