Library Carpentry is software and data skills training. Originally based on lessons developed by The Carpentries, Library Carpentry has evolved, and aims to help library professionals work more efficiently, and potentially teach the skills they have learned to colleagues, students, and researchers. Training takes place in face-to-face workshops.
