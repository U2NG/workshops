## Description

There are many actions researchers can take to increase the openness and reproducibility of their work. Please join us for a workshop, hosted by the [Center for Open Science](https://cos.io/), to learn easy, practical steps researchers can take to increase the reproducibility of their work. The workshop will be hands-on. Using example studies, attendees will actively participate in creating a reproducible project from start to finish.

### Topics covered:

* Project documentation
* Version control
* Pre-Analysis plans
* Open source tools like the Center for Open Scienceâ€™s Open Science Framework to easily implement these concepts in a  scientific workflow. 

This workshop is aimed at faculty, staff, and students across disciplines, who are engaged in quantitative research. The workshop does not require any specialized knowledge of programming. Participants will gain a foundation for incorporating reproducible, transparent practices into their current workflows.
