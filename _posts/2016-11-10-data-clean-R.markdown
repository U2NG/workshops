## Description

This workshop is geared to researchers wanting to use R for basic data manipulation and analysis. It will introduce participants to the basics of data tidying and manipulation (notably using tidyr & dplyr), how to set up data processing pipelines, and briefly cover working with a database. We will be using a genomics dataset for this course.  This workshop is designed for novices, but we would like you to have some experience with R or have attended the Intro to R course on 11/8.
