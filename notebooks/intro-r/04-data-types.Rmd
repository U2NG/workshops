## Data Structures

* How to read data into R?
* What are the basic data types?
* How to represent categorical information in R?

* R deals with tabular data very well.
* Let's create a csv file of cats.
* You can create `data/feline-data.csv` using a text editor (Nano), or within RStudio with the File -> New File -> Text File menu item.

```{r eval=FALSE}
coat,weight,likes_string
calico,2.1,1
black,5.0,0
tabby,3.2,1
```

* Read the file in: 

```{r read}
cats <- read.csv(file = "data/feline-data.csv")
cats
```
* `read.csv` used fr reading in tablula data stored in a text file, comma
* Tabs also common, use read.delim 
* If not tabs or commas, you can use the more general read.table 
* we can begin exploring using the $ operator

```{r}
cats$weight
```

```{r}
cats$coat
```

* We can do operations on columns:
```{r}
## say we discovered that the scale weighs two Kg light:
cats$weight + 2
```
```{r}
paste("My cat is", cats$coat)
```

**but what about**
```{r}
cats$weight + cats$coat
```

* understanding what happened here is **important**

## Data Types 

* If you guessed that 2.1 plus "black" is nonsense, you are right 
* important concept in programming language is `data types`
* we can inquire what type of data something is:

```{r}
typeof(cats$weight)
```

5 main types: 

* double
* integer
* complex
* logical 
* character

```{r}
typeof(3.14)
typeof(1L)
typeof(1+1i)
typeof(TRUE)
typeof('banna')
```
**note** the L suffix for indicating an number is an iteger

* no matter how complicated our analysis is all data in R is interepeted as of one of these basic types
* a user added details of another cat

```{r}
file.show("data/feline-data_v2.csv")
```
* load the new file & check what type of data we find in `weight`

```{r}
cats <- read.csv(file="data/feline-data_v2.csv")
typeof(cats$weight)
```

* oh no, our weights aren't the double type anymore!
* if we try to do the dsme math we did on them before we get unexpected results

```{r}
cats$weight + 2
```

**what happened?**

* R reads a csv into a table, it insists that everything in the tabl is the same basic type
* if it can't understand in the column as a `double` then nobody in the column gets to be a double
* the **table** that R loaded our cats data into is called a **data.frame** and our first example of something called a **data structure**
   * a structure that R knows how to build out of basic data types.

* we can see that it is a `data.frame` by calling the class function on it:

```{r}
class(cats)
```

* in order to use our data in R, we need to understand what the basic data sructures are & how they behave
* for now let's remove that extra line from out cats data and reload the data
* open the file and delete the bottom line

before: 
```{r eval=FALSE}
coat,weight,likes_string
calico,2.1,1
black,5.0,0
tabby,3.2,1
tabby,2.3 or 2.4,1
```
after:
```{r eval=FALSE}
coat,weight,likes_string
calico,2.1,1
black,5.0,0
tabby,3.2,1
```
```{r}
cats <- read.csv(file="data/feline-data.csv")
```

## Vectors and Type Coercion

```{r}
my_vector <- vector(length = 3)
my_vector
```

* a vector is an ordered list of things, with a special condition that *everything in the vector must be the same bacis data type* 
* fi you dont choose a datatype, it'll default to logcial
* you can declare an empty vector of whatever type you like

```{r}
another_vector <- vector(mode='character', length = 3)
another_vector
```
* check the vector with str

```{r}
str(another_vector)
```

* somewhat cryptic but indicates the type is vector and a chr, character
* also indicates the indexes of the vector [1:3]
* and a few examples of what's in the vector - empty strings here

```{r}
str(cats$weight)
```
* a vector, too-- the columns of data we load into R `data.frames` are all vectors
* and that's the root of why R forces everything in a coloumn to be the same type

###Why is R so opinionated about what we put in our columns of data? How does this help us?
### By keeping everything in a column the same, we allow ourselves to make simple assumptions about our data; if you can interpret one entry in the column as a number, then you can interpret all of them as numbers, so we donâ€™t have to check every time. This consistency, like consistently using the same separator in our data files, is what people mean when they talk about clean data; in the long run, strict consistency goes a long way to making our lives easier in R.

* you can make vectors with explicit contents with a c function 

```{r}
concat_vector <- c(2,6,3)
concat_vector
```

* given what we've learned so far, what would this produce:

```{r}
quiz_vector <- c(2,6,'3')
```

```{r}
str(quiz_vector)
```

* what happened above was *type conversion* and is the source of surprises and the reason we need to be aware of basic data types and how R deals with them
* When R encounters a mix of types (here numeric and character) to be combined in to a vector, it will force them to be the same type

```{r}
coercion <- c('a', TRUE)
str(coercion)
```
```{r}
another_coercion_vector <- c(0, TRUE)
another_coercion_vector
```
* the coercion rules go: **logical -> integer -> numeric -> complex ->**
  * Where `->` can be read as **are transformed into**
* You can try to force coercion against this flow using the `as.` functions

```{r}
character_vector_example <- c('0','2','4')
character_vector_example
```

```{r}
character_coerced_to_numeric <- as.numeric(character_vector_example)
character_coerced_to_numeric
```
```{r}
numeric_coerced_to_logical <- as.logical(character_coerced_to_numeric)
numeric_coerced_to_logical
```

* as you can see surprising things can happen when R forces one basic data type into another
* Nitty gritty of type coercion aside the point is:
  * if your data doesn't look like what you thought it was going to look like, type coercion may well be to blame 
* make sure everything is the same type in your vectors and your columns of `data.frames` or you will get bad surprises

* but coercion can be useful!
* ex. in our cat's data *likes_string* is number, but we know that the 1s and 0s actually represent TRUE and FALSE 
* we should use logical datatype here - TRUE or FALSE 
* we can coerce this column by using `as.logical`

```{r}
cats$likes_string
```

```{r}
cats$likes_string <- as.logical(cats$likes_string)
cats$likes_string
```

* concatenate will also append things to an existing vector:

```{r}

ab_vector <- c('a', 'b')
ab_vector
```

```{r}
concat_example <- c(ab_vector, 'SWC')
concat_example
```

* you can also make a series of numbers

```{r}
mySeries <- 1:10
mySeries
```
```{r}
seq(10)
```

```{r}
seq(1,10, by=0.1)
```

* we can ask a few questions of vectors

```{r}
sequence_example <- seq(10)
head(sequence_example, n=2)
tail(sequence_example, n=4)
length(sequence_example)
class(sequence_example)
typeof(sequence_example)
```
* finally, you can give names to elements in your vector
```{r}
names_example <- 5:8
names(names_example) <- c("a", "b", "c", "d")
names_example
names(names_example)
```

##Challenge 1
<http://swcarpentry.github.io/r-novice-gapminder/04-data-structures-part1#challenge-1>

## Data Frames

* we said that columns in `data.frames` were vectors

```{r}
str(cats$weight)
str(cats$likes_string)
str(cats$coat)
```
## Factors

* another important data structure is a **factor**
* factors appear to be character data, but are used to represent categorical information
* EX: a vector of strings labelling cat colorations for all cats in our study:

```{r}
coats <- c('tabby', 'tortoiseshell', 'tortoiseshell', 'black', 'tabby')
coats
str(coats)
```

* we can turn a vector into a factor like so

```{r}
CATegories <- factor(coats)
class(CATegories)
str(CATegories)
```

* now R has noticed that there are three possible categories in our data
* but prints out a bunch of numbers
* R has replaced our human-readable categories with numbered indices 

```{r}
typeof(coats)
typeof(CATegories)
```

## Challenge 2
<http://swcarpentry.github.io/r-novice-gapminder/04-data-structures-part1#challenge-2>

* in modelling functions, it's important to know what the baseline levels are
* this is assumed to be the first factor, but by default factors are labelled in aphabetical order
* you can change this by specifying levels:

```{r}
mydata <- c("case", "control", "control", "case")
factor_ordering_example <- factor(mydata, levels = c("control", "case"))
str(factor_ordering_example)
```

* in this case we explicitly told R that 'control' should be represented by 1 and case by 2
* this designation can be very important for interpreting the results of stats model

## Lists

* another data structure you'll want to learn is a `list`
* simpler in some ways than other types b/c you can put anything in it

```{r}
list_example <- list(1, "a", TRUE, 1+4i)
list_example
```
```{r}
another_list <- list(title = "Research Bazaar", numbers = 1:10, data = TRUE )
another_list
```

* we can now understand something surprising in our `data.frame` what happens if we: 

```{r}
typeof(cats)
```

* we see that `data.frames` look like lists under the hood 
* data.frame is really a list of vectors and factors 
* in order to hold those columns that are a mix of vectors and factors, the data.frame needs something a bit more flexible than a vector to put all those columns together into a table
* data.frame is a special ist in which all vectors must have same length

* in our cats exampel we have an integer, a double and logical variable

```{r}
cats$coat
cats[,1]
typeof(cats[,1])
str(cats[,1])
```

*each row is an observation of different variables, itself a `data.frame` and thus can be composed of element of diff. types

```{r}
cats[1,]
typeof(cats[1,])
str(cats[1,])
```

## Challenge 3
<http://swcarpentry.github.io/r-novice-gapminder/04-data-structures-part1#challenge-3>

## Matrices 

* Last but not least - matrix
* we can declare a matrix of zeros:

```{r}
matrix_example <- matrix(0, ncol=6, nrow=3)
matrix_example
```
* And similar to other data structures, we can ask things about our matrix:

```{r}
class(matrix_example)
typeof(matrix_example)
str(matrix_example)
dim(matrix_example)
nrow(matrix_example)
```
