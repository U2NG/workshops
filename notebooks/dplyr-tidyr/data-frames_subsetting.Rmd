## Data frame

Data frames are lists under the hood, so similar methods apply.
[ will act the same way as for lists, where each list is a column

```{r}
head(gapminder[3])
head(gapminder[["lifeExp"]]) # [[ will act to extract a single column
head(gapminder$year) #$ provides shorthand to extract columns by name
#With two arguments, [ behaves the same way as for matrices:
gapminder[1:3,]
gapminder[3,] #is a data frame b/c of the mixed types
```
