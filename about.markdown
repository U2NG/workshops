  <p>The UC San Diego Library offers data related workshops on various topics, including trainings on analytic tools, programming languages, data management and preparation.</p> 


Learning opportunities will cover topics that include:

* Best practices for basic data management.
* Using the DMPTool to develop a data management plan.
* Using data analysis tools (R, Python, Unix Shell, Github).
* Metadata Best Practices.

<p>We see data related training and workshops as an expansive part of library services.  We are interested in working with other partners and researchers in the campus community.</p>
